The idea of a perceptron is to have a single neuron that receives inputs, processes them and generates an output.

Every input has its own importance (weight): this allows the neuron to calculate the weighted sum of the inputs.

The neuron will then apply a non-linear activation function to it.


The purpose of this perceptron will be to perform a binary classification of the inputs using a supervised learning strategy.



This implementation will be based on the first paragraph of [ujjwalkarn](https://twitter.com/ujwlkarn)'s [A Quick Introduction to Neural Networks](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/09/quick-intro-neural-networks/)
